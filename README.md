# cursor_direction_handling_
"This JavaScript code is designed to dynamically change the cursor behavior in input fields based on the language being typed. It detects whether the input text contains English characters or not and updates the cursor style accordingly. When the input text is empty or contains English characters, it sets the cursor style to 'englishCursor,' and if the input text contains other characters like Urdu, it sets the cursor style to 'urduCursor.' This code enhances the user experience by aligning the cursor correctly based on the language context, improving text entry flow in multilingual input scenarios."
